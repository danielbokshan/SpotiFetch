# Welcome to SpotiFetch!

This is an interactive Python Script that downloads a Spotify playlist as mp3s from its link.

Before you can use this, make sure you set up a Spotify client ID and client Secret via the Spotify Developer portal. Set the client id and secret as environmental variables in Windows. The program will read these automatically.

Make sure you set them as..

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
and
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET

### Dependencies:
- spotipy
- pytube
- urlib
- requests

Run SpotifyDownloaderRunner.py and insert your playlist link when prompted.

# Features Coming Soon:
