#Welcome to SpotiFetch!

This is an interactive Python Script that downloads a Spotify playlist from its link.
Before you can use this, make sure you set up a Spotify client ID and client Secret via the Spotify Developer portal. Set the client id and secret as environmental variables in Windows. This will allow the program to read them automatically.

Also make sure to create a folder titled "Downloads" in the working directory.

###Dependencies:
- yt_api
- spotipy
- pytube
- urlib

Run SpotifyDownloaderRunner.py and insert your playlist link when prompted.

#Features Coming Soon:
- upgraded non-ascii character handling
- summary of failed downloads
