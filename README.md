Welcome to SpotiFetch!

This is an interactive Python Script that downloads a Spotify playlist from its link.
Before you can use this, make sure you set up a Spotify client ID and client Secret via the Spotify Developer portal.
Set the client id and secret as environmental variables in windows. This will allow the program to read them automatically.
Second, make sure to change the download paths throughout the program's modules. 
Run SpotifyDownloaderRunner.py.
